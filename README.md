# lr-paint
The absolute worst thing you will have ever seen. With QOI support!

It's essentially MSPaint. But Better! In ANY way shape or form!

If you pretend to need more features, YOU'RE WRONG

This is all one could possibly need for any art. Period

## What the hell is this?
This is a drawing program made for one purpose only: to be able to write an QOI exporter (more infos to qoi: [QOI Homepage](qoiformat.org))

It is supposed to be the most basic drawing program and somehow grew one tumor after another and ended up the absolute best thing ever produced!

## Features
You know 'em, you love 'em

Features

Well, ya betcha we have 'em!

### Mouse
| The Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| Left Mouse Button | Allows you to draw (hold it) |
| Right Mouse Button | Instantly exits the program, no questions asked, no saving, no nothing. You loose all your progress. Only implemented cuz I needed an easy way to exit. May be removed/replaced later |
| Mousewheel scroll | The one and only (literally) way to choose your color. Ya can go up. Ya can go down. Ya can even wrap around. It's great |
  
### Keyboard
| The Button | What it does |
|---|---|
| S | Saves the image in the only way anyone would ever need. As outputImage.qoi |
| Q | Instantly exits the program, no questions asked, no saving, no nothing. You loose all your progress. Only implemented cuz I needed an easy way to exit. May be removed/replaced/expanded later |
| R | Resets the Canvas to white |

### Color selector
Didn't you always wish you wouldn't have to choose colors yourself? It's sooooo annoying!

That's why we here at LR-PAIN:tm: decided, you shouldn't.

In LR-PAINT, you get 8 basic colors:

* Black
* White
* Red
* Green
* Blue
* Yellow
* Magenta
* Cyan

And even better, 8 **randomly** chosen colors! Don't like the colors you get? Restart the program and you get all new ones!
